                    My name is Jelena Tomic. I'm 28 years old. Born and raised in Serbia.

                    I moved to the United States in mid 2018.

                    I studied at the University of Belgrade and have a bachelor in traffic and transportation engineering.

                    Im currently working in a tracking company as a safety director.

                    While i was in college i also went to makeup school,
                    and became first assistant to a famous Serbian makeup artist.


                    I would say for myself that I'm an easy going person open to new adventures and always on the hunt to learn something new

                    In my free time I enjoy traveling and trying different foods. I also love movies
                    and visiting movie theaters.
